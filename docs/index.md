## :fontawesome-solid-address-card: About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition 2.0 is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over half a million regular users, it’s a powerful, open-source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

Portainer works by hiding the complexity that makes managing containers hard, behind an easy to use GUI. By negating the need for users to use CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so simple, anyone can do it.

The Portainer development team is here to assist you on your container journey; you can engage with them any time through our community-based support channels.

## :material-comment-account: Support Channels
  
Being a free and opensource product, we have been heavily reliant on our community to provide "how to" support to our community, recently we have invested significant time in improving and updating our documentation found on this site and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7diMJcrULjDseq5yhSUZgg). While we endeavour to cover as many scenarios as possible there may be some that our documentation doesn’t cover.

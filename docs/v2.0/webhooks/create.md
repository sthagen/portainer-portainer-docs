# Webhooks

You can use webhooks to trigger an action in a service in response to a push event in a repository. Webhooks are POST requests sent to a URL you define in Docker Hub or another registry.

## Enable Service Webhook

To enable a webhook for a service, go to <b>Services</b>, click on the service you want to set up the Webhook for, and enable the toggle <b>Service Webhook</b>.

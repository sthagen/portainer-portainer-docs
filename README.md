# Portainer Documentation

Welcome to the Portainer documentation repository. While our documentation is [hosted on Gitbook](https://docs.portainer.io/), we welcome and encourage community contributions through this repository.

## Branches

Our documentation is split into branches for each version of the product. This allows us to provide edition and version specific documentation as well as ensuring we can still provide help for those customers on older versions of Portainer. 

Branches are named with the edition prefix followed by the version number. For example, `ce-2.6` applies to version 2.6 of the Community Edition (CE) of Portainer.

## Issues

If you find an issue with the documentation, please create an [issue](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-docs/issues) in this repository. We keep a close eye on these issues and appreciate any feedback you can provide. 

If you would like to report an issue with Portainer itself, please do so in the [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues) repository.

## Pull requests

if you find an issue with the documentation and you have a suggested fix, you can create a [pull request](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-docs/pulls) to help us out. Remember to use the correct branch when submitting changes.
